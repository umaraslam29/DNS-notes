# DNS-notes

DNS stands for Domain Name System

DNS forms the backbone of the internet.

every websites will be hosted in a server somewhere. 

whenever we call the website we are actually calling the server for the website.

Each server will have its own ip address.

whenever we type the website address in a browser the website actually resolves to an ip address.

This resolving of ip address is done by the DNS.
